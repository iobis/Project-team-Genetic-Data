Data is stored in OBIS in the Darwin Core format (https://obis.org/manual/contribute/#standards), a standard for packaging and publishing biodiversity data updated by TDWG. A Darwin core archive contains a core file which links a sampling event or specimen collection to extension files containing additional information on the identified occurrences. Two different types of core files are allowed: either occurrence cores like in the case of specimen collections, or event cores which link a specific sampling event (for example research expedition) to the logged occurrences in this event.

In addition to occurrence information, OBIS allows connecting extended measurement information to either the events or occurrences, through their IDs. An important factor to note is that the DwC archive does not allow occurrences to be logged to more than one event. Practically this means that occurrence by sample tables can not be added as such, but need to be formatted to the long format (each sample and occurrence combination is one row, i.e. each occurrence has a unique ID). This is a very important factor to take into consideration when dealing with genetic data, and the implications will be discussed further in later sections.
