At the moment these guidelines are directly from the [GBIF guidelines](https://docs.gbif-uat.org/publishing-dna-derived-data/1.0/en/) for publishing genetic data.

>Although DNA-derived datasets often are event-based in nature, i.e. hundreds or even thousands of quantified sequence occurrences may derive from a single sampling event and thus share most metadata attributes. The current recommendation is to publish data as Occurrence core with the [DNA derived data extension](http://rs.gbif.org/sandbox/extension/dna_derived_data.xml). This approach compensates for limitations of the DwC star schema, which would not allow any occurrence-level data in extension files (such as processed barcode sequences) to point to records in an event core file. We do, however, recommend including an eventID for each core record, to indicate the association between occurrences derived from the same sampling event.
