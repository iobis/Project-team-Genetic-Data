

Welcome to the Genetic Data Project team guidelines!
Feel free to make suggestions to these documents.

Here we will collect the guidelines and information on how genetic data will be published on OBIS.
These guidelines are a work in progress. As they are being modified, and developed, it means that they may still change.
Therefore datasets that are formatted based on these guidelines, may still need to be slightly modified and reformatted in the future.
We recommend trying them out, but keeping this in mind!
